In many cases, the language code and the country where the language is spoken is the same, but it is also often not the case. For example, while 'se' refers to Sweden, where Swedish is spoken, the language code for Swedish is <b>not</b> <code>se</code> (which refers to the Northern Sami language), the language code is <code>sv</code>. And similarly the region code for <code>sv</code> is El Salvador.<br/>
<br/>
This lint check looks for suspicious language and region combinations, to help catch cases where you've accidentally used the wrong language or region code. Lint knows about the most common regions where a language is spoken, and if a folder combination is not one of these, it is flagged as suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
Note however that it may not be an error: you can theoretically have speakers of any language in any region and want to target that with your resources, so this check is aimed at tracking down likely mistakes, not to enforce a specific set of region and language combinations.<br/>]]></description>

However, that version was copied into new projects, which means that it does not continue to get updated as we improve the default ProGuard rules for Android.<br/>
<br/>
In the new version of the tools, we have split the ProGuard configuration into two halves:<br/>
* A simple configuration file containing only project-specific flags, in your project<br/>
* A generic configuration file containing the recommended set of ProGuard options for Android projects. This generic file lives in the SDK install directory which means that it gets updated along with the tools.<br/>
<br/>
In order for this to work, the proguard.config property in the <code>project.properties</code> file now refers to a path, so you can reference both the generic file as well as your own (and any additional files too).<br/>
<br/>
To migrate your project to the new setup, create a new <code>proguard-project.txt</code> file in your project containing any project specific ProGuard flags as well as any customizations you have made, then update your project.properties file to contain:<br/>
<code>proguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt</code><br/>]]></description>

By default this detector allows regions of a language to just provide a subset of the strings and fall back to the standard language strings. You can require all regions to provide a full translation by setting the environment variable <code>ANDROID_LINT_COMPLETE_REGIONS</code>.<br/>
<br/>
You can tell lint (and other tools) which language is the default language in your <code>res/values/</code> folder by specifying <code>tools:locale="languageCode"</code> for the root <code>&lt;resources></code> element in your resource file. (The <code>tools</code> prefix refers to the namespace declaration <code>http://schemas.android.com/tools</code>.)<br/>]]></description>

In locales like English, the <code>one</code> quantity only applies to a single value, 1, but that's not true everywhere. For example, in Slovene, the <code>one</code> quantity will apply to 1, 101, 201, 301, and so on. Similarly, there are locales where multiple values match the <code>zero</code> and <code>two</code> quantities.<br/>
<br/>
In these locales, it is usually an error to have a message which does not include a formatting argument (such as '%d'), since it will not be clear from the grammar what quantity the quantity string is describing.<br/>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Potential Plurals<br/>This lint check looks for potential errors in internationalization where you have translated a message which involves a quantity and it looks like other parts of the string may need grammatical changes.<br/>
<br/>
For example, rather than something like this:<br/>
  &lt;string name="try_again">Try again in %d seconds.&lt;/string><br/>
you should be using a plural:<br/>
   &lt;plurals name="try_again"><br/>
        &lt;item quantity="one">Try again in %d second&lt;/item><br/>
        &lt;item quantity="other">Try again in %d seconds&lt;/item><br/>
    &lt;/plurals><br/>
This will ensure that in other languages the right set of translations are provided for the different quantity classes.<br/>
<br/>
(This check depends on some heuristics, so it may not accurately determine whether a string really should be a quantity. You can use tools:ignore to filter out false positives.<br/>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Unused quantity translations<br/>Android defines a number of different quantity strings, such as <code>zero</code>, <code>one</code>, <code>few</code> and <code>many</code>. However, many languages do not distinguish grammatically between all these different quantities.<br/>
<br/>
This lint check looks at the quantity strings defined for each translation and flags any quantity strings that are unused (because the language does not make that quantity distinction, and Android will therefore not look it up.).<br/>
For example, in Chinese, only the <code>other</code> quantity is used, so even if you provide translations for <code>zero</code> and <code>one</code>, these strings will <b>not</b> be returned when <code>getQuantityString()</code> is called, even with <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.<br/>]]></description>

<br/>
By default, this flag is set to <code>true</code>. When this flag is set to <code>true</code>, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using <code>adb backup</code> and <code>adb restore</code>.<br/>
<br/>
This may have security consequences for an application. <code>adb backup</code> allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. <code>adb restore</code> allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.<br/>
<br/>
Setting <code>allowBackup="false"</code> opts an application out of both backup and restore.<br/>
<br/>
To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set <code>android:allowBackup=(true|false)"</code><br/>]]></description>

Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called "overdraw".<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.<br/>
<br/>
If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.<br/>

This is the same as the <code>drawable</code> resource directory, except resources in the <code>mipmap</code> directory will not get stripped out when creating density-specific APKs.<br/>
<br/>
In certain cases, the Launcher app may use a higher resolution asset (than would normally be computed for the device) to display large app shortcuts. If drawables for densities other than the device's resolution have been stripped out, then the app shortcut could appear blurry.<br/>
<br/>
To fix this, move your launcher icons from `drawable-`dpi to `mipmap-`dpi and change references from @drawable/ and R.drawable to @mipmap/ and R.mipmap.<br/>

<br/>
The lint detector also looks at the <code>id</code> of the view, and if the id offers a hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the <code>id</code> contains the phrase <code>phone</code> or <code>email</code>), then lint will also ensure that the <code>inputType</code> contains the corresponding type attributes.<br/>

If you really want to keep the text field generic, you can suppress this warning by setting <code>inputType="text"</code>.<br/>]]></description>

Negative values are generally a sign that you are making assumptions about views surrounding the current one, or may be tempted to turn off child clipping to allow a view to escape its parent. Turning off child clipping to do this not only leads to poor graphical performance, it also results in wrong touch event handling since touch events are based strictly on a chain of parent-rect hit tests. Finally, making assumptions about the size of strings can lead to localization problems.<br/>]]></description>
